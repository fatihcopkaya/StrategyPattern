# Strategy Pattern with and without Keyed Services

This repository demonstrates two different implementations of the Strategy Pattern in C#:

1. StrategyPattern: A basic implementation using factory methods.
2. StrategtPatternWithKeyedService: An advanced implementation using .NET 8's KeyedService for Dependency Injection.

## Project Structure

- StrategyPattern: A traditional implementation of the Strategy Pattern with a factory class.
- StrategtPatternWithKeyedService: An implementation that leverages .NET 8's KeyedService feature.
